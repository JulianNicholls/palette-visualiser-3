# palette-visualiser-3

This is a rewrite of the palette visualiser
[here](https://github.com/JulianNicholls/Palette-Visualiser)
written with React and Webpack 4.

## Change Log

03/2018: Update to React 16.3, removing deprecated functions.
03/2018: Changed the colour conversions to use objects rather than arrays.

07/2018: The latest (well, next, actually) version of extract-text-webpack-plugin works with Webpack 4 and is now enabled.

08/2018: Display the list of named HTML colours, e.g. Dark Slate Blue

10/2018: Update to use the context API.
10/2018: Add the [xkcd survey colours](https://blog.xkcd.com/2010/05/03/color-survey-results) as another colour list.

## Git client

I have used Git at the command-line for 10 years.
Over that time, I have tried many different graphical shells for Git,
without finding one that was easier and nicer to use than the command-line
(in my view).

I have now found that [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) is an excellent
Git shell and would advise using it to everyone.
