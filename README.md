# palette-visualiser-3

This is a rewrite of the palette visualiser
[here](https://github.com/JulianNicholls/Palette-Visualiser)
written with React and Webpack 4.

## Change Log

The functionality is really complete now.

Changed the colour conversions to use objects rather than arrays.

Updated to React 16.3.

The latest (well, next, actually) version of extract-text-webpack-plugin works with Webpack 4 and is now enabled.
